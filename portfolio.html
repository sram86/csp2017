     <center><p><strong><font size= "3">This is a remix my group and I were able to create. We added a score keeper that keeps track of how many points the user is able to gain. We also incorporated another paddle to the game to make it more challenging, and a timer that stops the game after 35 seconds. We were able to make the balls say, "Times up!" after the 35 seconds, and make the score tracker stop tracking the score after the time is up. In addition, the background changes to a brick wall when the time is up.</font></strong></p></center>

     <center><p><strong><font size= "3">This is a game that is similar to the Super Mario Bros. game, but with a twist. This is from the perspective of Goomba, one of Mario's enemies. In this game, Goomba is trying to capture Princess Peach, however, Mario is the trying to stop him. When Goomba fianlly makes it through all the levels, a cage will fall on top of Princess Peach, allowing Goomba to capture Peach.Here is a video of me explaining the game:

     <center><p><strong><font size= "3">This is an interactive story my partner and I created using python. It is a horror story in which someone is having a nightmare, and must try to escape the dream or they could get stuck there forever. This is more of a lucid dream since the character in the story has powers. There are alternate endings to the story and multiple ways that lead up to the end of the story.
